# Python Directory and Files Management :


A directory or folder is a collection of files and sub directories.

Python has the os module, which provides us with many useful methods to
work with directories (and files as well).
"""**********************************************************"""
# PYTHON OS Module :

import os
# Executing a shell command
os.system("/root") 
# Get the users environment 
os.environ   
# Returns the current working directory.
os.getcwd()   
# Return the real group id of the current process.
os.getgid()       
# Return the current processâ€™s user id.
os.getuid()    
# Returns the real process ID of the current process.
os.getpid()     
# Set the current numeric umask and return the previous umask.
os.umask(mask)   
# Return information identifying the current operating system.
os.uname()     
# Change the root directory of the current process to path.
os.chroot(path)   
# Return a list of the entries in the directory given by path.
os.listdir(path) 
# Create a directory named path with numeric mode mode.
os.mkdir(path)    
# Recursive directory creation function.
os.makedirs(path)  
# Remove (delete) the file path.
os.remove(path)    
# Remove directories recursively.
os.removedirs(path) 
# Rename the file or directory src to dst.
os.rename(src, dst)  
# Remove (delete) the directory path.
os.rmdir(path)
"""**********************************************************"""
# Get Current Directory :
"""
We can get the present working directory using the getcwd() method.
This method returns the current working directory in the form of a string.
We can also use the getcwdb() method to get it as bytes object.
"""
import os
os.getcwd()
#'C:\\Program Files\\PyScripter'
os.getcwdb()
#b'C:\\Program Files\\PyScripter'
"""Note:
The extra backslash implies escape sequence.
The print() function will render this properly.

print(os.getcwd())
#C:\Program Files\PyScripter"""

"""**********************************************************"""
# Changing Directory :

We can change the current working directory using the chdir() method.

The new path that we want to change to must be supplied as a string to
this method.

We can use both forward slash (/) or the backward slash (\) to separate
path elements.

It is safer to use escape sequence when using the backward slash.

os.chdir('C:\\Python33')

print(os.getcwd())
# C:\Python33
"""**********************************************************"""
# List Directories and Files :

All files and sub directories inside a directory can be known using
the listdir() method.

This method takes in a path and returns a list of sub directories and files in that path.

If no path is specified, it returns from the current working directory.

>>> print(os.getcwd())
C:\Python33

>>> os.listdir()
['DLLs',
'Doc',
'include',
'Lib',
'libs',
'LICENSE.txt',
'NEWS.txt',
'python.exe',
'pythonw.exe',
'README.txt',
'Scripts',
'tcl',
'Tools']

>>> os.listdir('G:\\')
['$RECYCLE.BIN',
'Movies',
'Music',
'Photos',
'Series',
'System Volume Information']
"""**********************************************************"""
# Making a New Directory :

We can make a new directory using the mkdir() method.

This method takes in the path of the new directory.

If the full path is not specified, the new directory is created
in the current working directory.

os.mkdir('test')

os.listdir()
# ['test']
"""**********************************************************"""
# Renaming a Directory or a File :

The rename() method can rename a directory or a file.

The first argument is the old name and the new name must be supplies
as the second argument.

os.listdir()
['test']

os.rename('test','new_one')

os.listdir()
# ['new_one']

"""**********************************************************"""
# Removing Directory or File :

A file can be removed (deleted) using the remove() method.

Similarly, the rmdir() method removes an empty directory.

os.listdir()
# ['new_one', 'old.txt']

os.remove('old.txt')
os.listdir()
# ['new_one']

os.rmdir('new_one')
os.listdir()
# []

However, note that rmdir() method can only remove empty directories.

In order to remove a non-empty directory we can use the rmtree() method
inside the shutil module.

os.listdir()
#['test']

os.rmdir('test')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
OSError: [WinError 145] The directory is not empty: 'test'

import shutil

shutil.rmtree('test')
os.listdir()
# []
"""**********************************************************"""
# Python file operations :

1. Open a file
2. Read or write (perform operation)
3. Close the file

# Builtin Functions:
1. open()
2. close()

f = open("test_1.txt")    # open file in current directory
f = open("C:/Users/Jessicah Princess/Desktop/test_1.txt")  # specifying full path

"""**********************************************************"""
# Python File Modes:
------------------
Mode	Description
'r'		Open a file for reading. (default)
'w'		Open a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not 
		exist or truncates the file if it exists.
'x'		Open a file for exclusive creation.
                If the file already exists, the operation fails.
'a'		Open for appending at the end of the file
                without truncating it. 
		Creates a new file if it does not exist.
't'		Open in text mode. (default)
'b'		Open in binary mode.
'+'		Open a file for updating (reading and writing)
"""**********************************************************"""
f = open("test.txt")      # equivalent to 'r' or 'rt'
f = open("test.txt",'w')  # write in text mode
f = open("img.bmp",'r+b') # read and write in binary mode
"""**********************************************************"""
# Encoding:
The default encoding is platform dependent. 
In windows, it is 'cp1252' but 'utf-8' in Linux. 
"""**********************************************************"""

Closing a file will free up the resources that were tied with the file and
is done using the close() method.

f = open("test.txt",encoding = 'utf-8')
f.read()
f.readlines()
# perform file operations
f.close()

Note: This method is not entirely safe. 

# try...finally method:

If an exception occurs when we are performing some operation with the file, 
the code exits without closing the file. 
A safer way is to use a try...finally block.

try:
   f = open("test.txt",encoding = 'utf-8')
   # perform file operations
finally:
   f.close()
   
Note: This way, we are guaranteed that the file is properly closed even if
an exception is raised, causing program flow to stop.

# with statement :
The best way to do this is using the "with" statement. 
This ensures that the file is closed when the block inside with is exited. 
We dont need to explicitly call the close() method. It is done internally.


with open("test.txt",encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
   # perform file operations

"""**********************************************************"""
# Script mode:

with open("test.txt",'w',encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
   f.write("my first file\n")
   f.write("This file\n\n")
   f.write("contains three lines\n")

# Interactive mode:

>>> f = open("test.txt",'r',encoding = 'utf-8')
>>> f.read(4)    # read the first 4 data
'This'
>>> f.read(4)    # read the next 4 data
' is '
>>> f.read()     # read in the rest till end of file
'my first file\nThis file\ncontains three lines\n'
>>> f.read()  # further reading returns empty sting
''
>>> f.tell()    # get the current file position
56
>>> f.seek(0)   # bring file cursor to initial position
0
>>> print(f.read())  # read the entire file
This is my first file
This file
contains three lines

"""**********************************************************"""
We can read a file line-by-line using a for loop. 
This is both efficient and fast.

>>> for line in f:
...     print(line, end = '')
...
This is my first file
This file
contains three lines

Note: The lines in file itself has a newline character '\n'.
Moreover,the print() function also appends a newline by default.
Hence, we specify the end parameter to avoid two newlines when printing.
"""**********************************************************"""
# readline() method to read individual lines of a file :

# This method reads a file till the newline, including the newline character.

>>> f.readline()
'This is my first file\n'

>>> f.readline()
'This file\n'

>>> f.readline()
'contains three lines\n'

>>> f.readline()
''

Lastly, the readlines() method returns a list of remaining lines of the entire file. 
All these reading method return empty values when end of file (EOF) is reached.

>>> f.readlines()
['This is my first file\n', 'This file\n', 'contains three lines\n']
"""**********************************************************"""
Python File Methods:
********************

There are various methods available with the file object. 
Some of them have been used in above examples. 
Here is the complete list of methods in text mode with a brief description.

Python File Methods:

Method		Description
close()		Close an open file. It has no effect if the file is already closed.
detach()	Separate the underlying binary buffer from the TextIOBase and return it.
fileno()	Return an integer number (file descriptor) of the file.
flush()		Flush the write buffer of the file stream.
isatty()	Return True if the file stream is interactive.
read(n)		Read atmost n characters form the file. Reads till end of file if it is negative or None.
readable()	Returns True if the file stream can be read from.
readline(n=-1)	Read and return one line from the file. Reads in at most n bytes if specified.
readlines(n=-1)	Read and return a list of lines from the file. Reads in at most n bytes/characters if specified.

# Python Exception Handling - Try, Except and Finally :

How to handle exceptions in your Python program using try, except and finally statements.

This will motivate you to write clean, readable and efficient code in Python.

# Flow:

Try(Exception may occur)--> Raise(Raise the exception)-->Excep(Catch if exception occurs)

Python has many built-in exceptions which forces your program to output an error
when something in it goes wrong.

Python (interpreter) raises exceptions when it encounter errors. 

try...finally
The try statement in Python can have an optional finally clause.

This clause is executed no matter what, and is generally used to release external resources.

For example, we may be connected to a remote data center through the network or working
with a file or working with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

In all these circumstances, we must clean up the resource once used,
whether it was successful or not. These actions (closing a file, GUI or disconnecting from network)
are performed in the finally clause to guarantee execution.

# Here is an example of file operations to illustrate this.

try:
   f = open("test.txt",encoding = 'utf-8')
   # perform file operations
finally:
   f.close()
This type of construct makes sure the file is closed even if an exception occurs.
